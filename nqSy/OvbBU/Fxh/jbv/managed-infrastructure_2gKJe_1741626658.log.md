# Contributing guidelines

This repo is primarily used by those people administering actual *.k8s.io sites, but Pull Requests are certainly
welcome from anyone who has ideas on how to improve the configurations.  We'd like this repo to demonstrate the 
best practices for running sites on Kubernetes.
